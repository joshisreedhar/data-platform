# Data Lineage Solutions and Architecture

## Types of Data Lineage

### 1. Technical Lineage
- **Column-Level Lineage**
  - Tracks transformations at individual column level
  - Shows precise data flow between fields
  - Captures data type changes
  - Maps source-to-target relationships

- **Table-Level Lineage**
  - Shows relationships between tables
  - Tracks dataset dependencies
  - Maps data flow between systems
  - Identifies impact of changes

- **SQL-Based Lineage**
  - Parses SQL queries
  - Extracts transformation logic
  - Maps source-target relationships
  - Shows query dependencies

### 2. Business Lineage
- **Process Lineage**
  - Business processes and workflows
  - Data ownership and stewardship
  - Business rules and policies
  - Impact analysis

- **Semantic Lineage**
  - Business terms and definitions
  - Data domains
  - Business classifications
  - Usage context
